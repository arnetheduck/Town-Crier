# Fork notes

[IC3 2019 Bootcamp project](https://www.initc3.org/events/2019-06-10-IC3-Blockchain-Boot-Camp.html)

[The dark DAO](http://hackingdistributed.com/2018/07/02/on-chain-vote-buying/)
can be thwarted if we can prove that bribee has unencumbered access to private
key and thus fool the briber.

This fork has nothing to do with town crier really, except it reuses that code
infrastructure, which was easy to modify to throw in the key calculations :)

# Town Crier: An Authenticated Data Feed For Smart Contracts

Smart contracts systems today lack trustworthy sources of data, as currently
deployed oracles provide only weak provenance and confidentiality guarantees.
The Town Crier (TC) system leverages trusted hardware (Intel SGX) to provide a
strong guarantee that data comes from an existing, trustworthy source. It also
provides confidentiality, enabling smart contracts to support confidential
queries and manage user credentials.

Please read on for build instructions for the TC enclave.
